## Ideally, we should mark here and then compare: QC and help kids who might have versioned wrong; or catch kids who versioned wrong on purpose (to copy)
## scoreTable should not be used for decoding, since it's missing kids we need but who didn't take the exam
## In 2017, it's not part of the final pipeline at all
